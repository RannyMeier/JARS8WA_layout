<h3>LongList</h3>

<p>LongList is a control that displays a list of items. It is similar to the List control, but it is optimized for displaying a large number of items. It only renders the items that are currently visible on the screen, and it reuses the same elements as the user scrolls through the list. This makes it much more efficient than the List control for displaying large lists.</p>
